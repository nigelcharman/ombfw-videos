# Updating Old Man's Beard status

We'd love your help to check Old Man's Beard patches and update their status.

See our previous video "Using the CAMS weed map" to find existing Old Man's Beard patches that need checking.

## Using iNaturalist
```

We use iNaturalist, a citizen science platform, to report and update Old Man's Beard in Wellington.

<!-- Observations are synchronised hourly from iNaturalist to the CAMS weed map.

iNaturalist provides a mobile app and can be used via a browser. 

To update the status of weed patches, we need to use the browser version (you can only currently update your own observations on mobile). -->

![](iNaturalist screenshot.png)

In order to update an observation, you'll need to have an iNaturalist account. If you don't have one already, sign up at iNaturalist.org.

Add the observation to the Weed Management Aotearoa NZ project, if it's not already added. 

To add it, type *Weed* into the Add to a Project field and select Weed Management Aotearoa NZ.

This observation is already added to the project so we click on the cog next to the project name and select the *Fill out project observation fields* option.

If you have controlled the weed, please update at least the "Treated?", "Date controlled", "How treated" and "Treatment substance" fields. 

You don't need to update the "Status update" field in this case, the status will automatically change based on the treatment fields you have filled in.

# Congratulations!
```

Congratulations!

You have now updated the status of this weed patch.

---

![](CAMS Weed App OMB Mortimer updated.png)

The map will be updated to show the new status within an hour after you've made the change.

You can check the updated map on either the mobile app or via the browser.

If it's not updated, check that you filled in the fields shown in this video. 

Also check you have clicked the Add button next to each modified field.

Checking the map after an hour, we see this dot has turned to "Red" to show there is active growth.

Updating the status might seem like a lot of work to start with, but it quickly becomes second nature.

In time, we hope to develop a mobile app to make this easier.
