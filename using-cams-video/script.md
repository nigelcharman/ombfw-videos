# Using the CAMS weed map

![](CAMS Weed App.png)

Hi! On our mission to make Wellington Old Man's Beard Free, we're using a map to manage and track our efforts in controlling the weed.

This map is colour coded to show which patches need control, which patches have been controlled, and which patches need checking.

The map was developed by EcoNet as part of its CAMS (Conservation Activity Management System) suite.

With over 3,000 reported Old Man's Beard patches, we can't check them all!

We'd love your help to check some of them and update this map. 

This video shows you how to use the CAMS map. 

We've adapted the map to allow you to enter new weeds and update their status using the iNaturalist platform.

Subsequent videos will show you how to use iNaturalist to add a new Old Man's Beard patch or to update the status of a patch on this map.

The public CAMS map shows weed patches entered using iNaturalist and is open for public access without signing in.

It can be used on your mobile device or in a browser on your computer.

It is useful to install it on your mobile for use in the field.

See cams.econet.nz/public for instructions on how to install or open the public map.

![](CAMS Field Maps Initial.png)

On opening the map, you'll notice a lot of different coloured markers. 

Each marker represents a weed patch and is coloured to show the current known status of the patch. 

---

![](CAMS Legend.png)

The common colours are:

Red: growth is occurring which needs controlling.

Purple: the patch needs checking.

Yellow: the patch has been controlled this year

And Green: there is no regrowth this year.
  
The shape of the marker also indicates whether control work is needed or not. Diamond shaped markers indicate that no weed control is currently needed.

Old Man's Beard seeds remain viable for about 10 years and the patches need rechecking regularly for new seedlings.

![](CAMS Legend.png)

To facilitate this, the weed status is reset to "Purple - Please Check" each Spring, so that the weed patches are checked for re-growth or seedlings.

Click on the relevant weed marker on the map to select it.

If there are a few weed markers close together, they may show up as a list. 

In this case, you can either click on the relevant item on the list or zoom in further and click on the relevant marker on the map.

Once the weed marker is selected, some basic information about the weed patch will be displayed.

The GPS position isn't always right, so you may need to hunt around to find the weed.

If you need more info to help find it, click on the link under iNaturalist URL. 

This will open the iNaturalist page which shows more details, including photos, to help you find it.

Let's try finding a known Old Man's Beard patch.

Opening ArcGIS Field Maps, it shows the CAMS map.

After zooming in to my current location, I see I need to walk down the road to get to the Old Man's Beard patch.

I'm getting close, so I'll click on the icon to find out more details.

There's no location description, so I'll click on the iNaturalist URL to see a photo of it.

That looks like the bank across the road from me.

Let's click on the photo, so I can zoom in and see where the Old Man's Beard is.

There it is on the top right of the bank.

Looking around the bank now, the Old Man's Beard vines seem to have been mostly controlled. 

But I can see some regrowth at the top of the bank.

The subsequent video will show you how to update the status of a weed patch on the map.
