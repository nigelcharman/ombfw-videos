# Using the CAMS weed map

&nbsp;

![](CAMS Weed App.png)

Hi! On our mission to make Wellington Old Man's Beard Free, we're using a map to manage and track our efforts in controlling the weed.

This map is colour coded to show which patches need control, which patches have been controlled, and which patches need checking.

The map was developed by EcoNet as part of its award winning CAMS (Conservation Activity Management System) suite.

With over 3,000 reported Old Man's Beard patches, we can't check them all!

We'd love your help to check and update them.

This video shows you how to find them and update their status on this map.

To add a new OMB patch, see the "Reporting Old Man's Beard" video.

## Understanding the weed map
```

(pause: 3)

![](CAMS Field Maps Initial.png)

On opening the map, you'll notice a lot of different coloured markers. 

Each marker represents a weed patch and is coloured to show the current known status of the patch. 

---

![](CAMS Legend.png)

The common colours are:

Red: growth is occurring which needs controlling.

Purple: the patch needs checking.

Yellow: the patch has been controlled this year

And Green: there is no regrowth this year.
  
The shape of the marker also indicates whether control work is needed or not. Diamond shaped markers indicate that no weed control is currently needed.

Old Man's Beard seeds remain viable for about 10 years and the patches need rechecking regularly for new seedlings.

---

![](CAMS Legend.png)

To facilitate this, the weed status is reset to "Purple - Please Check" each Spring, so that the weed patches are checked for re-growth or seedlings.

Once the weed marker is selected, some basic information about the weed patch will be displayed.

The GPS position isn't always right, so you may need to hunt around to find the weed.

If you need more info to help find it, click on the link under iNaturalist URL.

Going back to the CAMS app, under the weed information you'll see the "Update Weed Status" button.

Click on this to update the status.

This will prompt you to log onto iNaturalist if you're not logged in already.

If you have controlled the weed patch, click "Controlled". Otherwise click "Alive" or "Dead" as appropriate.

After filling in relevant details, click the "Update Observation" button. This will update the iNaturalist observation. The weed status on the CAMS map will be updated within the hour.

Let's try finding a known Old Man's Beard patch.

Opening ArcGIS Field Maps, it shows the CAMS map.

After zooming in to my current location, I see I need to walk down the road to get to the Old Man's Beard patch.

I'm getting close, so I'll click on the icon to find out more details.

There's no location description, so I'll click on the iNaturalist URL to see a photo of it.

That looks like the bank across the road from me.

Let's click on the photo, so I can zoom in and see where the Old Man's Beard is.

There it is on the top right of the bank.

Looking around the bank now, the Old Man's Beard vines seem to have been mostly controlled. 

But I can see some regrowth at the top of the bank.

I'll update the weed status to say it's Alive and fill in some details.
